# Password Generator Project:

## Description:

**In this project I added to the JavaScript starter code in order to create a random password generator application that will create unique passwords for users based on the criteria they select. I utilized multiple prompts in order to acquire user input and then created a function that will generate a random password that meets their chosen criteria.**
